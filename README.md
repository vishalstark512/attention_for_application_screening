# attention_for_application_screening

Downlaod DonorsChoose dataset ann run this LSTM based self attention mkechanism based screening test.
Thw model we created uses glove vectors as well, so we need to downlaod that as well to run this code.

This is a multi-input single output type of model, you can remove the attention mechanism line from the newtowrk architecture to see the performance dip when we dont' use self attention mechanism.
